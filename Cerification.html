            I completed a Full Stack Web Development course at Tap Academy, where I gained knowledge in Core Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JDBC, JEE, JavaScript, Hibernate, and Spring Boot.
            I developed a strong understanding of both frontend and backend technologies.
            Throughout the course, I worked on real-world projects that enhanced my problem-solving and coding skills.
            This hands-on experience helped me build dynamic and responsive web applications with efficient backend integration.
